Then it was off to college at MIT where more formal\ncomputing and programming came naturally, leading to a Bachelors in\nComputer Science.\n\nNot putting a lot of thought into it (_bad idea_), I headed West to\ngrad school for more Computer Science at UC Berkeley. The research\ngroup I joined consisted of folks interested in programming language\ndesign and implementation, PLDI, as a foundation for advanced software\ndevelopment environments. Think today’s [Visual Studio\nCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) on machines\nfrom 30 years ago. I carved out a minor niche in the area of scripting\nlanguage design for such platforms leading to a successfully completed\ndissertation (_good idea_). I also completed a minor in Journalism.\nJust being part of the Computer Science Division, I also picked up\ngeneral interests in Systems research (computer architecture,\noperating systems, networking, databases, distributed systems,\netc.). I jokingly consider myself an adjunct of the (fictitious)\nBerkeley Systems Mafia.\n\nBefore filing my dissertation, I started a tenure track faculty\nposition at Northwestern University. While I fizzled out as a\nprofessor, I loved living in the greater Chicago area, and my\ninterests in media and technology were brought together. Working with\na colleague in the Medill School of Journalism, I deployed content\nmanagement system technology into the newsroom that every Journalism\nmasters student spent a couple of quarters working in. A renowned\ncompatriot in English and History allowed me to collaborate in the\ndevelopment of an online essay documenting Daniel Burnham’s [_The Plan\nof\nChicago_](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/10537.html)\n\nSubsequently, I moved to Northern Virginia taking on a sequence of\nindustry jobs which you can see below, all of which were engaged with\ncomputing research in some fashion.
